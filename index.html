        <p>My name is Richard Noll and I am trying to teach an old dog some new tricks.   I am the old dog and the new tricks are related to web development programming using C# .NET. When I first took a college programming class in 1982, I took a course in Basic at Scottsdale Community College.  I also took courses in COBOL and Fortran while I was working on my Bachelor's degree at ASU.</p>

        <h1>My Background</h1>

        <p> I have worked in the IT areas of Business Intelligence and Database programming for the past 16 years. Regarding education and training, I earned a Ph.D. degree in IT Organization and Management from Capella University and a Master of Science degree in Computer Information Systems from the University of Phoenix. I also attended Arizona State University where I got my Bachelor of Science degree, majoring in Psychology. What was I thinking?!</p>

        <h1>Why the move from Psychology to Programming?</h1>

        <p>I first became interested in programming in High School in 1981 during my Senior year at Coronado High in Scottsdale, AZ.  Our math instructor at Coronado had a special programming class that used terminals connected to the City of Scottsdale mainframe computer.  The school had an agreement with the City of Scottsdale to provide computing time for their students using the City's mainframe. The terminals were Decwriters (hard copy type, no green screen displays) that were connected to the City of Scottsdale mainframe by acoustic coupled modems. So, as time when by, I learned about the DOS operating system, Windows 3.1, Windows 95, Windows 2000, etc.   Then came the Internet and the web browser to keep my interest in computers and IT alive. I initially started out in IT in the areas of IT Tech Support and LAN Administration.  I transitioned into the areas of database development and reporting. Developing skills in .NET web development is the next step in expanding my IT skills set.   </p>
